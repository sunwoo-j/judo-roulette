# Judo Roulette
This program is designed to be used in the final rounds of Judo mixed teams matches in the Olympics. The roulette _randomly_ selects a weight category for the deciding match in a visually engaging manner. It includes the configuration to call up Teddy Rene in case of French emergency.
