This program is designed to be used in the final round (round 7) of Judo mixed teams matches in the Olympics. The roulette _randomly_ selects a weight category for the deciding round in a visually engaging manner. 

It includes the configuration to call up [**Teddy Riner**](https://www.instagram.com/teddyriner/) in case of French emergency.
